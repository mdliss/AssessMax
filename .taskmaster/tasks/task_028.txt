# Task ID: 28
# Title: Develop Batch Processing with AWS Lambda
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement asynchronous batch processing using AWS Lambda and SQS.
# Details:
Set up AWS Lambda functions to handle batch processing of transcripts and artifacts. Use SQS for job queuing and Step Functions for orchestration.

# Test Strategy:
Test batch processing for scalability and reliability. Ensure jobs are processed correctly and logs are maintained.
