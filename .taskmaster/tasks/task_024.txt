# Task ID: 24
# Title: Develop NLP Scoring Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Build an NLP pipeline to score non-academic skills from transcripts and artifacts.
# Details:
Use Hugging Face, spaCy, and NLTK to implement stages: language detection, cleanup, sentence segmentation, diarization mapping, skill cue detection, scoring, and explanation extraction. Ensure reproducibility with deterministic seeds.

# Test Strategy:
Validate pipeline outputs against sample data. Ensure skill scores and evidence are accurate and reproducible.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Language Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the language detection stage using NLP tools.
### Details:
Use spaCy and Hugging Face models to detect the language of transcripts. Ensure accuracy and handle multiple languages.

## 2. Develop Text Cleanup Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Create a module to clean up transcripts for processing.
### Details:
Implement text normalization, remove noise, and standardize formats using NLTK and spaCy.

## 3. Create Sentence Segmentation Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Segment transcripts into sentences for further analysis.
### Details:
Use spaCy to accurately segment text into sentences, considering punctuation and language nuances.

## 4. Implement Diarization Mapping [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Map speaker diarization to transcript segments.
### Details:
Integrate diarization tools to associate speakers with text segments, ensuring accurate speaker identification.

## 5. Develop Skill Cue Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Detect skill cues within segmented sentences.
### Details:
Use Hugging Face models to identify and extract skill-related cues from text segments.
