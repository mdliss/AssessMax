{"speaker": "Sarah Chen", "text": "Good morning everyone. Our team researched renewable energy, specifically solar power. Before I start, I want to acknowledge my teammates Emma and Marcus - they did amazing work on this project.", "timestamp": "11:00:15", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"}

{"speaker": "Sarah Chen", "text": "That's okay, I'll wait... So, as I was saying, solar panels convert sunlight into electricity through photovoltaic cells.", "timestamp": "11:01:00", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"}

{"speaker": "Sarah Chen", "text": "Oh, sorry! Is this better? I'll project my voice more. Let me repeat that last part for anyone who missed it. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity through photovoltaic cells.", "timestamp": "11:01:45", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"}

{"speaker": "Sarah Chen", "text": "That's a great question! Let me explain it another way. Think of it like a plant doing photosynthesis, but instead of making food, the panel makes electricity. The sunlight hits special materials that get excited and create an electric current.", "timestamp": "11:02:30", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"}

{"speaker": "Sarah Chen", "text": "Awesome! Does anyone else have questions before I continue? I want to make sure everyone understands each part.", "timestamp": "11:03:15", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"}

{"speaker": "Sarah Chen", "text": "Perfect timing Emma! Yes, this will help visualize what I just explained. Marcus, do you want to explain your building process?", "timestamp": "11:03:45", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"}

{"speaker": "Sarah Chen", "text": "Thank you! I practiced a lot last night, but I was still really nervous. Taking a breath when my phone buzzed helped me stay focused.", "timestamp": "11:10:15", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"}
