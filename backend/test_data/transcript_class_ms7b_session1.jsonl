{"speaker": "Teacher", "text": "Good morning class! Today we're discussing the novel we've been reading. Let's start with themes.", "timestamp": "09:00:00", "student_id": null}
{"speaker": "James Brown", "text": "I noticed the main character struggles with making friends. I think that's a really important theme.", "timestamp": "09:00:30", "student_id": "e931ed29-797a-4381-a263-d78bd241c923"}
{"speaker": "Teacher", "text": "Excellent observation James. Can anyone build on that?", "timestamp": "09:00:45", "student_id": null}
{"speaker": "Emma Johnson", "text": "Yeah! I think it connects to what James said - the character learns that being vulnerable actually helps them connect with others.", "timestamp": "09:01:00", "student_id": "4d5fb6f5-135d-45a4-8283-d4de15df5e72"}
{"speaker": "Noah Anderson", "text": "That's true, but I disagree slightly. I think the theme is more about authenticity than vulnerability.", "timestamp": "09:01:30", "student_id": "177ca80c-cee9-4d06-b917-be78c7c117c5"}
{"speaker": "Emma Johnson", "text": "Oh interesting! Can you explain what you mean by authenticity?", "timestamp": "09:01:45", "student_id": "4d5fb6f5-135d-45a4-8283-d4de15df5e72"}
{"speaker": "Noah Anderson", "text": "Well, the character stops pretending to be someone they're not. That's different from just being vulnerable - it's about being genuine.", "timestamp": "09:02:00", "student_id": "177ca80c-cee9-4d06-b917-be78c7c117c5"}
{"speaker": "James Brown", "text": "I see what you mean Noah. Actually, both vulnerability and authenticity are probably part of it.", "timestamp": "09:02:30", "student_id": "e931ed29-797a-4381-a263-d78bd241c923"}
{"speaker": "Mia Moore", "text": "Can I add something? I think the character also learns to listen better. In chapter 5, they finally hear what their friend has been trying to tell them.", "timestamp": "09:03:00", "student_id": "bd745f35-e311-4b12-a21b-a0530e674ef8"}
{"speaker": "Alicia Rivera", "text": "Yes! And that's when things start to change for them. Good catch Mia!", "timestamp": "09:03:30", "student_id": "f83cd7e0-b789-468d-8477-d5dbe5d8ec3f"}
{"speaker": "Teacher", "text": "I'm impressed by how you're all building on each other's ideas. Let's talk about the ending now.", "timestamp": "09:04:00", "student_id": null}
{"speaker": "Alicia Rivera", "text": "The ending was surprising. I expected the character to reconcile with their old friend, but instead they made new connections.", "timestamp": "09:04:30", "student_id": "f83cd7e0-b789-468d-8477-d5dbe5d8ec3f"}
{"speaker": "Emma Johnson", "text": "I was surprised too at first, but then I realized it shows growth. Sometimes moving forward means making new relationships instead of fixing broken ones.", "timestamp": "09:05:00", "student_id": "4d5fb6f5-135d-45a4-8283-d4de15df5e72"}
{"speaker": "James Brown", "text": "That's a mature perspective Emma. I hadn't thought of it that way.", "timestamp": "09:05:30", "student_id": "e931ed29-797a-4381-a263-d78bd241c923"}
{"speaker": "Mia Moore", "text": "Do you think the author was trying to say something about forgiveness? Or is it more about knowing when to let go?", "timestamp": "09:06:00", "student_id": "bd745f35-e311-4b12-a21b-a0530e674ef8"}
{"speaker": "Noah Anderson", "text": "I think it's both. The character forgives but also recognizes that the relationship isn't healthy anymore. That takes a lot of self-awareness.", "timestamp": "09:06:30", "student_id": "177ca80c-cee9-4d06-b917-be78c7c117c5"}
{"speaker": "Alicia Rivera", "text": "I agree with Noah. And I think that's actually the hardest part - knowing when to walk away even after you've forgiven someone.", "timestamp": "09:07:00", "student_id": "f83cd7e0-b789-468d-8477-d5dbe5d8ec3f"}
{"speaker": "Teacher", "text": "These are all excellent insights. You're demonstrating real critical thinking about complex relationships.", "timestamp": "09:07:30", "student_id": null}
{"speaker": "James Brown", "text": "Can we do a group project analyzing the character development? I think we could create something really interesting together.", "timestamp": "09:08:00", "student_id": "e931ed29-797a-4381-a263-d78bd241c923"}
{"speaker": "Emma Johnson", "text": "That sounds great! We could divide it by chapters and then combine our analyses.", "timestamp": "09:08:30", "student_id": "4d5fb6f5-135d-45a4-8283-d4de15df5e72"}
{"speaker": "Mia Moore", "text": "I'd be happy to work on the middle chapters where the biggest changes happen.", "timestamp": "09:08:45", "student_id": "bd745f35-e311-4b12-a21b-a0530e674ef8"}
{"speaker": "Noah Anderson", "text": "And I can focus on how the writing style changes as the character develops. The author's voice shifts subtly.", "timestamp": "09:09:00", "student_id": "177ca80c-cee9-4d06-b917-be78c7c117c5"}
{"speaker": "Alicia Rivera", "text": "I noticed that too Noah! We could collaborate on that analysis since I was tracking the dialogue patterns.", "timestamp": "09:09:30", "student_id": "f83cd7e0-b789-468d-8477-d5dbe5d8ec3f"}
{"speaker": "Teacher", "text": "This is exactly the kind of collaborative work I was hoping to see. Let's finalize your groups and get started.", "timestamp": "09:10:00", "student_id": null}
