{"speaker": "Emma Johnson", "text": "Our group got the budget planning problem. Should we divide up the calculations?", "timestamp": "10:00:30", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"}
{"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Maybe we should read through it together first? I want to make sure I understand what we're solving for.", "timestamp": "10:00:45", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002"}
{"speaker": "Sarah Chen", "text": "That's a good idea Marcus. Let me read it out loud so we're all on the same page.", "timestamp": "10:01:00", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"}
{"speaker": "Ethan Rodriguez", "text": "Okay, so we need to figure out if the school can afford new sports equipment with their current budget.", "timestamp": "10:01:30", "student_id": "924bf274-1e01-4f9d-a7aa-3ceab3a71bbd"}
{"speaker": "Emma Johnson", "text": "Right. And we have to account for existing expenses. Marcus, you're good with spreadsheets - want to set up our calculations?", "timestamp": "10:02:00", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"}
{"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Sure, I can do that. But I'm going to need help with the percentages part. That's not my strongest area.", "timestamp": "10:02:30", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002"}
{"speaker": "Ava Wilson", "text": "I can help with percentages! I just did a bunch of practice problems on that yesterday.", "timestamp": "10:02:45", "student_id": "bea2c866-cecb-4de7-8bd7-4b9afb76173f"}
{"speaker": "Sarah Chen", "text": "This is working well. Everyone's contributing what they're good at.", "timestamp": "10:03:00", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"}
{"speaker": "Ethan Rodriguez", "text": "Wait, I think we made a mistake on line three. The transportation costs should be subtracted, not added.", "timestamp": "10:03:30", "student_id": "924bf274-1e01-4f9d-a7aa-3ceab3a71bbd"}
{"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "Oh no, you're right. Let me fix that... There we go.", "timestamp": "10:03:45", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002"}
{"speaker": "Emma Johnson", "text": "Good catch Ethan! That would have thrown off our whole answer.", "timestamp": "10:04:00", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"}
{"speaker": "Ava Wilson", "text": "Now that we've fixed that, the remaining budget is $3,450. Do we have enough for the equipment?", "timestamp": "10:04:30", "student_id": "bea2c866-cecb-4de7-8bd7-4b9afb76173f"}
{"speaker": "Sarah Chen", "text": "Let me add up the equipment costs... Looks like it's $3,200 total. So yes, but barely!", "timestamp": "10:05:00", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"}
{"speaker": "Alicia Rivera", "text": "Should we recommend they buy everything, or save some money for emergencies?", "timestamp": "10:05:30", "student_id": "c7786217-1636-4add-8e02-ab8fc6f523cd"}
{"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "That's actually a really smart question. Real budgets need cushion for unexpected expenses.", "timestamp": "10:05:45", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002"}
{"speaker": "Emma Johnson", "text": "What if we prioritize the most important equipment and save the rest for later? That way they have some emergency funds.", "timestamp": "10:06:00", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"}
{"speaker": "Ethan Rodriguez", "text": "I like that approach. Let's rank the equipment by how many students would use it.", "timestamp": "10:06:30", "student_id": "924bf274-1e01-4f9d-a7aa-3ceab3a71bbd"}
{"speaker": "Ava Wilson", "text": "The soccer goals would be used by the most people, so those should definitely be first priority.", "timestamp": "10:06:45", "student_id": "bea2c866-cecb-4de7-8bd7-4b9afb76173f"}
{"speaker": "Sarah Chen", "text": "And the basketballs are pretty cheap, so we can include those too.", "timestamp": "10:07:00", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003"}
{"speaker": "Alicia Rivera", "text": "So our recommendation is: buy the soccer goals and basketballs now, save $500 for emergencies, and plan to buy the other items next semester?", "timestamp": "10:07:30", "student_id": "c7786217-1636-4add-8e02-ab8fc6f523cd"}
{"speaker": "Marcus Williams", "text": "That sounds perfect. Let me write up our final recommendation.", "timestamp": "10:08:00", "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002"}
